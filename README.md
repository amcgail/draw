Well here we are.

This code is aimed at better note-taking.
It stores notes in localStorage, renders them with canvas.
A user can draw using the mouse, add text with shift click, or create links by clicking and holding until the "draw a link" function begins.
Links connect a drawing to other drawings, or take action on the window at a meta level.
Eventually I plan to code the whole website from within drawings.

Currently there's a lot that's broken, and a lot to be done.
